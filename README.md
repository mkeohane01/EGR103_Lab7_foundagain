# EGR103_Lab7_foundagain

A collection of code and other resources from EGR103 (Computational methods in engineering) Lab 7 from April 2020. Code was done for an assignment and therefore was overseen by teachers and TAs and it isn't commented well. This is just one assignment that we had to do, but it is a good representation of the python scripts we worked on.
